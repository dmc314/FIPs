# Post Shark (nv17) Upgrade - Revisiting a Sector Duration Multiplier 

## Summary 
[FIP-0036](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0036.md) proposed cryptoeconomic changes to the Filecoin protocol, and was the subject of lively debate within the Filecoin community beginning in July 2022. Ultimately, this FIP was **rejected** for inclusion in the upcoming nv17 "Shark" network upgrade. While FIP-0036 was rejected, many believe its overarching goals were directionally positive for the network. There have been renewed calls to revisit the problem-space FIP-0036 sought to address, especially amidst an uncertain economic environment both within and external to the Filecoin Network. 

## Problem Motivatioin
Since FIP-0036's rejection in September 2021, the macroeconomic environment, as well as the health of the Filecoin network have continued to worsen.

### Macroeconomic Commentary 
FIP-0036 was introduced in July 2022 amidst an uncertain and bearish outlook both within the blockchain space and in the broader global economy. One of the intended goals of the FIP was to introduce economic incentives to provide the network with tools to weather macroeconomic uncertainty, through introducing rewards for Storage Provider's long-term commitment to the network. Since the FIP's introduction, the global macroeconomic environment has only worsened, and cryptocurrency has faced a myriad of compounding additional headwinds. Volatility continues within web3, and the duration of this industry downturn is unclear. Following, FIP-0036's rejection in September 2022, the crypto industry, and by extension the Filecoin economy has been weathering unexpected shocks and industry-defining black swan events. 

### State of the Filecoin Network 
Within the Filecoin Network, the amount of hardware backing the network continues to shrink.
